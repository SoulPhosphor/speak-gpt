# Phosphor Shines — UI Redesign Master Plan

**Date:** June 13, 2026
**Status:** Phase 1 implemented locally; Phase 0 completed previously. This document is the
specification for the "UI overhaul" referenced in CLAUDE.md's roadmap.
**Audience:** AI agents implementing the redesign. Read `CLAUDE.md` in full
before this document — every rule there still applies. This plan was written
after a complete inventory of all 30 activities, 20+ dialog fragments, and
88 layouts, with the load-bearing facts (view-ID contracts, theme structure,
dependency versions) verified directly against the code on commit `8e6584d`.

---

## 0. How to use this document

This redesign will likely be implemented across many sessions, possibly by
less capable models. The rules below exist because the riskiest failure mode
is not "ugly UI" — it is silently breaking the hands-free voice pipeline or
the per-chat preference system while restyling things.

**Rules of engagement (non-negotiable):**

1. **One phase — or one sub-step of a phase — per branch/PR.** Never combine
   a theming change with a layout redesign in the same PR. Small diffs are
   reviewable; 4,000-line diffs in this codebase get merged with bugs.
2. **CI is the compile gate.** There is no local Android SDK in agent
   sandboxes. Before pushing, statically verify: every `R.*` reference
   resolves, every new id exists in the layout actually inflated, XML is
   well-formed, imports exist. Push, then confirm the `Android Checks`
   workflow run is green before starting the next step.
3. **Restyle, don't refactor.** The redesign changes how screens *look*.
   It must not change how `ChatActivity`'s voice loop, streaming, or
   preference logic *works*. If a visual goal seems to require a logic
   change, stop and ask the owner.
4. **Never rename a view ID, widget type, drawable, or color that code
   references** without updating every reference — Section 9 lists the
   verified contracts. When in doubt, `grep` before touching.
5. **Every change to chat input/messages UI must be mirrored** in both
   `ChatActivity` and `AssistantFragment` (the floating assistant). They are
   parallel implementations.
6. **If reality disagrees with this document** (the code moved on, an ID
   changed), trust the code, re-verify with grep, and update this document
   in the same PR.
7. Update `CLAUDE.md` and this file whenever a phase completes, so the next
   agent knows where the project stands. Add a ✅ and the merge commit hash
   to the phase list in Section 8.

## 1. Locked decisions (owner-approved, 2026-06-13)

These were decided explicitly by the owner. Do not re-litigate them.

| Decision | Choice |
|---|---|
| UI technology | **Stay on classic Views/XML + Material 3 (MDC-Android).** No Jetpack Compose, not even for new screens. |
| Navigation | **Left slide-out drawer** containing the chat list (new chat, search) plus quick navigation (Characters hub, Playground, Settings). The chat screen becomes the effective home screen, like the ChatGPT/Claude apps. No right-side panel. |
| Theming | **Preset hand-designed color palettes** in light and dark variants, selectable in settings. Material You / wallpaper-dynamic color was explicitly **not** chosen. The existing AMOLED pitch-black mode must keep working. |
| Style target | Clean, elegant, modern Material 3 — rounded surfaces, proper spacing, M3 type scale. |

---

## 2. Research findings & library policy

### 2.1 The Material library situation (important)

- **MDC-Android (the Views Material library) 1.14.0 is the final stable
  release** (May 2026). The library is now in **maintenance mode** — only
  critical fixes, no new features. Google's investment has moved to Compose.
- The good news: 1.14 ships full **Material 3 Expressive** support for Views
  (the `Theme.Material3Expressive.*` themes, updated component styles,
  loading indicators, button groups, new shape/motion values).
- What this means for us: the Views stack is *stable and frozen*, which is
  actually fine for this app — no surprise breaking upgrades, and everything
  in this plan works with 1.14. The trade-off accepted by choosing Views is
  that we will never get future Material features; we get a polished
  snapshot of M3 instead.

**Action:** bump `com.google.android.material:material` from `1.14.0-beta01`
to the final `1.14.0` stable in Phase 0, then treat it as pinned (add it to
the "do not upgrade" list — there is nothing to upgrade to).

### 2.2 Edge-to-edge is mandatory

The app targets SDK 36 (Android 16). At target 36 the edge-to-edge opt-out
attribute is **deprecated and disabled** — the app cannot opt out of drawing
behind the system bars. Several activities already call `enableEdgeToEdge()`
and the themes use transparent system bars, but every *redesigned* screen
must handle insets deliberately (Section 6.6 gives the recipe). A recent
commit ("fix Voice settings insets") shows this has already bitten once.

### 2.3 Libraries to use (all already in the project)

| Library | Version | Role in redesign |
|---|---|---|
| `com.google.android.material:material` | 1.14.0 (bump from beta01) | All components, M3 themes, color roles |
| `androidx.appcompat:appcompat` | 1.7.1 | Base activities/widgets |
| `androidx.drawerlayout:drawerlayout` | 1.2.0 (add explicit dep) | The side panel. Currently only pulled in transitively; declare it explicitly when the drawer work starts. |
| `androidx.recyclerview` | (present) | Chat list inside the drawer |
| `androidx.constraintlayout` | (present) | Keep for existing screens |
| `io.noties.markwon:*` | 4.6.2 | Markdown rendering — **do not replace** |
| `com.github.bumptech.glide:glide` | 5.0.5 | Images/avatars — keep |
| `androidx.core:core-splashscreen` | 1.2.0 | Already present |
| `com.github.Dimezis:BlurView` | 2.0.6 | Used by debug overlays + chat attach background — leave as-is |

### 2.4 Libraries NOT to add (deliberate)

- **No Jetpack Compose** (owner decision).
- **No AndroidX Navigation component.** The app uses plain
  activity-to-activity intents everywhere; retrofitting a nav graph is a
  refactor with zero visual payoff and high regression risk.
- **No third-party drawer, theme-engine, animation (Lottie), or icon
  libraries.** Every dependency is a maintenance liability; M3 components
  cover everything this plan needs.
- **Never touch Ktor (pinned 2.3.12), OkHttp TLS defaults, or the OpenAI
  clients** as part of UI work. (See CLAUDE.md "Do not touch".)

---

## 3. Order of operations (why theming comes first)

The phases in Section 8 are ordered deliberately:

1. **Theme-attribute migration first** (invisible groundwork). Preset
   palettes require every layout and every Kotlin color lookup to go through
   *theme attributes* instead of hard-coded `@color/accent_*` references.
   If we restyled screens first and migrated colors later, every screen
   would be touched twice and the palette work would risk re-breaking
   finished screens.
2. **Palette system + picker second** — proves the foundation works while
   the UI still looks familiar.
3. **Navigation drawer third** — the biggest structural change, done while
   the chat screen internals are still untouched.
4. **Screen restyles last** — lowest-risk, screen-by-screen, each one a
   small PR.

---

## 4. Theming architecture (preset color palettes)

### 4.1 Current state (verified June 2026)

- `Theme.App` (parent `Theme.Material3.DayNight.NoActionBar`) in
  `res/values/themes.xml`, with a `values-night` variant. Per-activity
  overrides: `Theme.Transparent` (ChatActivity, SettingsActivity, permission
  activities), `Theme.Assistant` (floating assistant), `UI.Fade`/`UI.Material`
  (animation variants of Theme.App), `Theme.PWA`.
- Colors are a tier system `accent_50 … accent_900` plus
  `window_background`, defined in `values/colors.xml` and `values-night/colors.xml`.
- **36 layout files reference `@color/accent_*` directly; zero layouts use
  `?attr/` theme attributes.** This is the main blocker for palettes.
- **AMOLED mode is not a theme.** It is runtime recoloring: ~29 Kotlin files
  contain `if (isAmoled)` blocks that call `setBackgroundColor`/`setTint`
  etc. with `amoled_*` colors read via
  `Preferences.getAmoledPitchBlack()`. `theme/ThemeManager.kt` only retints
  three shared button drawables (`btn_accent_tonal_v4`, `btn_accent_tonal_v5`,
  `btn_accent_icon_large_100`).

### 4.2 Target design

**One source of truth: Material theme attributes.** A "palette" is a
`ThemeOverlay` style that redefines the M3 color roles (`colorPrimary`,
`colorOnPrimary`, `colorPrimaryContainer`, `colorSecondaryContainer`,
`colorSurface`, `colorSurfaceContainer`, `colorSurfaceContainerHigh`,
`colorOnSurface`, `colorOnSurfaceVariant`, `colorOutline`, …). Light/dark
variation continues to come from `values/` vs `values-night/` color
resources referenced by each overlay — the DayNight mechanism is untouched.

**Suggested initial palettes** (final colors are a design task; each needs a
full M3 role set in light + dark):

| Palette key | Idea |
|---|---|
| `violet` | The current purple palette, repackaged. **Default** — existing users see no change. |
| `phosphor` | Green-on-dark, the app's namesake. |
| `ocean` | Cool blue/teal. |
| `ember` | Warm amber/orange. |
| `mono` | Neutral grayscale with a single restrained accent. |

**Selection mechanics:**

- Store the palette key in `GlobalPreferences` (e.g. `ui_palette`,
  default `violet`). Global, not per-chat.
- Extend `theme/ThemeManager.kt` with
  `applyPalette(activity: Activity)` that reads the preference and calls
  `activity.theme.applyStyle(R.style.ThemeOverlay_Phosphor_<Palette>, true)`
  **before `setContentView`** in `onCreate`. Every activity must call it
  (there is no BaseActivity in this codebase — adding one is optional but
  touching ~30 `onCreate`s with one line is the lower-risk path; the
  screen-by-screen checklist in Section 7 doubles as the list).
- The theme picker (new "Appearance" entry in SettingsActivity) calls
  `recreate()` on the current activity after saving. Other activities pick
  it up on their next `onCreate`. Add a swatch-row preview UI (a row of
  colored circles, selected one outlined — no live preview needed in v1).
- Dialogs and bottom sheets created from an activity context inherit the
  activity's theme (including applied overlays). **Verify this per screen**
  during the palette phase — `QuickSettingsBottomSheetDialogFragment` is the
  canary because it overrides `ThemeOverlay.App.BottomSheetDialog`.
- `Theme.Transparent` (ChatActivity!) and `Theme.Assistant` activities also
  need `applyPalette` — they inherit Material3 color roles even though
  their window backgrounds are transparent.

### 4.3 The migration (Phase 1) — mechanical but wide

For each screen (layout XML + its Kotlin file):

1. **Layouts:** replace `@color/accent_*` / `@color/window_background`
   references with the matching theme attribute. Mapping guidance:

   | Current usage | Replace with |
   |---|---|
   | `accent_900` as icon tint / emphasized text | `?attr/colorPrimary` (or `?attr/colorOnSurface` for plain text — judge by role, not by color value) |
   | `accent_500` filled-button/strong backgrounds | `?attr/colorPrimary` (+ `colorOnPrimary` content) |
   | `accent_100` / `accent_50` soft container backgrounds | `?attr/colorSurfaceContainer` / `colorSurfaceContainerHigh` or `colorSecondaryContainer` for tinted chips |
   | `window_background` | `?attr/colorSurface` (theme `android:windowBackground` keeps a concrete color) |

   Judge each occurrence by *what role it plays*, not by mechanical
   find-replace — an `accent_900` that colors body text is `colorOnSurface`,
   not `colorPrimary`.
2. **Kotlin:** replace `ContextCompat.getColor(context, R.color.accent_*)` /
   `ResourcesCompat.getColor(...)` with
   `MaterialColors.getColor(view, com.google.android.material.R.attr.colorPrimary)`
   (or the appropriate role). `MaterialColors` resolves against the view's
   themed context, so overlays apply correctly.
3. **Shared drawables** (`btn_accent_tonal*`, `btn_accent_icon_large*`,
   `expandable_window_background*`, `tile_inactive`, …): these are used by
   many screens at once. Migrate their internal color references to theme
   attributes (`?attr/...` works inside drawable XML on minSdk 28) — and
   test every screen that uses the drawable in the same PR, because one
   drawable edit restyles many screens simultaneously.
4. **Vector icons** currently tinted `@color/accent_900` per CLAUDE.md
   convention: change the convention to `?attr/colorPrimary` (update the
   CLAUDE.md coding-rules line when this lands).

**Colors that must NOT become palette-driven (keep as literal resources):**

- `mic_listening_green` and `hands_free_active_red` — these are *semantic
  voice-state* colors (recording / hands-free active). Users learn them;
  they must look identical in every palette. Used in `ChatActivity`,
  `AssistantFragment`, `ChatAdapter`, defined in `colors.xml`.
- Error/destructive reds in confirm dialogs (use `?attr/colorError` where
  it is already Material-managed, but don't map them to palette accents).

### 4.4 AMOLED interplay

Two-stage plan:

- **During Phases 1–2:** keep the existing runtime mechanism working. When
  migrating/restyling a screen, search its Kotlin file for
  `getAmoledPitchBlack` / `isAmoled` / `amoled_` and make sure those blocks
  still produce a correct pitch-black look on the new layout. Skipping this
  silently breaks AMOLED users (the owner uses dark themes; assume AMOLED is
  exercised).
- **Phase 2.5 (cleanup, optional but recommended):** once everything reads
  colors from theme attributes, AMOLED becomes just another overlay applied
  *after* the palette overlay, forcing `colorSurface`/`colorSurfaceContainer*`
  to pure-black tiers. Then the ~29 scattered `if (isAmoled)` blocks can be
  deleted screen-by-screen. Do not attempt this big-bang; one screen per PR,
  AMOLED toggled on in your head (or screenshot via CI artifacts if
  available) for each.

## 5. Navigation redesign — the side panel

### 5.1 What the drawer contains (top to bottom)

1. **Header** — app name; optionally the active persona's avatar/name later.
2. **"New chat" row** (replaces the chats-tab FAB; opens the existing
   `AddChatDialogFragment`).
3. **Search field** filtering the chat list (reuse the filter logic from
   `ChatsListFragment`'s `search_input`).
4. **Chat list** — RecyclerView, reusing `ChatPreferences` as the data
   source and the visual style of `view_chat_name_min.xml` rows (name +
   snippet; model labels stay out of the drawer for cleanliness). Current
   chat highlighted with a `colorSecondaryContainer` pill.
5. **Divider**, then static nav rows: **Characters** (→ `CharactersActivity`
   hub: personas / activation prompts / system message / lorebooks),
   **Playground** (→ the existing `PlaygroundFragment` rehosted or its own
   activity), **Settings** (→ `SettingsActivity`).

Implement as a `DrawerLayout` whose drawer pane is a **custom layout**
(header + RecyclerView + rows). Do **not** use `NavigationView` menu items —
the chat list is dynamic and menu-item hacks fight the framework.

### 5.2 Where the drawer lives, and the migration path

Today: `MainActivity` (bottom tabs: Chats / Playground) → tap a chat →
`ChatActivity`. The target: open the app, land in your last chat, drawer on
the left. Get there in three separately-shippable steps:

- **Step A — drawer inside ChatActivity.** Wrap the root of
  `activity_chat.xml` in a `DrawerLayout` (the existing
  `expandable_window_root` CoordinatorLayout becomes the main pane —
  preserve its ID and the `chat_expand` transitionName). Add a hamburger
  button to the chat top bar. Keep `btn_back` working as today.
- **Step B — launch into the last chat.** Record the last-opened chat id in
  `GlobalPreferences`; `MainActivity` forwards straight into `ChatActivity`
  for that chat when it exists (first-run/no-chats still shows the current
  chats screen). When ChatActivity is the task root, `btn_back` shows the
  hamburger icon and opens the drawer instead of finishing.
- **Step C — retire the bottom tab bar.** Once the drawer covers everything
  (chats, Playground, settings), remove `BottomNavigationView` from
  `MainActivity` and slim it down to a router + first-run host. Tips/Tools
  fragments fold into Settings or are dropped (ask owner before deleting
  features).

Ship A, then B, then C — never as one PR.

### 5.3 Hard rules for the drawer (voice-pipeline safety)

- **Switching chats from the drawer = `finish()` the current ChatActivity
  and start a new one** with the new chat id (the same lifecycle as today's
  list-tap navigation, so voice teardown in `onDestroy` keeps working).
  **Never** implement in-place chat swapping inside a live ChatActivity in
  this redesign — the voice loop, streaming state, and per-chat preferences
  all assume one chat per activity instance.
- The **auto-naming** flow renames the chat *in place* (changes the chat id
  without relaunching the activity — relaunching kills readback and the
  hands-free loop). The drawer's chat list must therefore refresh its data
  when opened (re-read `ChatPreferences` in `onDrawerStateChanged`/
  `onDrawerOpened`), not cache ids from activity start.
- Opening/closing the drawer must not touch mic state, keyboard insets
  handling (`keyboard_frame`), or `restoreUIState()` logic.
- `AssistantFragment` (the floating overlay) gets **no drawer** — it is a
  bottom-sheet experience and stays one.
- Drawer pane must apply status-bar insets (edge-to-edge: content starts
  below the status bar; the pane itself may draw behind it).
- Back handling: drawer open → back closes the drawer; otherwise current
  behavior. Test with gesture nav (predictive back is the default on
  Android 16; `DrawerLayout` 1.2.0 handles it, but verify the
  `OnBackPressedDispatcher` interplay if ChatActivity has custom back
  logic — grep for `onBackPressed`/`OnBackPressedCallback` first).

---

## 6. Design language (the "clean, elegant, modern" spec)

### 6.1 Shape
- Chat input bar: pill container (28dp radius), full-width with 12–16dp
  horizontal margins.
- Message bubbles: 20dp radii with a 6dp "tail-side" corner (bottom-end for
  user, bottom-start for assistant).
- Cards/tiles/dialog surfaces: 16–24dp. Bottom sheets: 28dp top corners
  (M3 default).

### 6.2 Color roles (post-migration)
- Backgrounds: `colorSurface`; elevated rows/cards: `colorSurfaceContainer`
  tiers — **no hard-coded grays.**
- User bubble: `colorPrimaryContainer` / `colorOnPrimaryContainer`.
- Assistant bubble: `colorSurfaceContainerHigh` / `colorOnSurface`.
- Accent moments (FAB, send button, selected states): `colorPrimary` or
  `colorSecondaryContainer`.

### 6.3 Typography
- Keep the bundled fonts (`roboto_ttf` day / `default_font` night — they are
  theme-wired; don't add new font files).
- Apply the M3 type scale via `textAppearance` attributes
  (`?attr/textAppearanceTitleLarge` for screen titles,
  `BodyLarge` for messages, `LabelLarge` for buttons) instead of raw `sp`.

### 6.4 Components
- Top bars: the app uses hand-rolled ConstraintLayout action bars
  (`action_bar` in chat, similar elsewhere). **Keep that structure** —
  restyle (height, title typography, icon buttons with 48dp touch targets)
  rather than introducing `AppBarLayout`/`MaterialToolbar` into ChatActivity,
  where scroll-behavior side effects could disturb the RecyclerView/keyboard
  inset choreography. New/simple screens *may* use `MaterialToolbar`.
- Settings tiles (`TileFragment`) → restyled as M3 list rows or filled
  cards with leading icons; keep the `TileFragment` API so `SettingsActivity`
  / `CharactersActivity` logic is untouched.
- Lists: keep `ListView`+`BaseAdapter` where they exist (persona/endpoint/
  prompt lists) — restyle the *item layouts* only. Migrating list widgets is
  explicitly out of scope (regression risk for zero visual gain).
- Buttons: `Widget.Material3.Button.TonalButton` default (already the
  pattern), filled for primary CTAs, plain icon buttons elsewhere.

### 6.5 Motion
- Keep existing activity fade transitions (`UI.Fade` / `UI.Material`) and the
  chat `chat_expand` shared-element transition. M3 Expressive motion springs
  are a nice-to-have **last** polish phase, never a prerequisite.
- Mic-button state changes must remain *instant* (no animation that delays
  the recording/hands-free indicator).

### 6.6 Edge-to-edge inset recipe (apply to every redesigned screen)
- Activity calls `enableEdgeToEdge()` (most already do).
- Root content view gets an `OnApplyWindowInsetsListener` that pads the
  top bar by the status-bar inset and the bottom-most interactive element by
  `max(navigationBars, ime)` insets. ChatActivity already manages IME insets
  around `keyboard_frame` — **do not** add a second listener there; extend
  the existing one if needed.
- Scrollable content uses `clipToPadding=false` + bottom padding so the last
  item clears the nav bar.

## 7. Screen-by-screen checklist

Work through these in the phase order of Section 8. "Risk" = chance of
breaking behavior while restyling. Every row eventually gets: palette
attributes (Phase 1), then visual restyle (its listed phase).

### 7.1 Core surfaces (high care)

| Screen | Files | What changes | Risk / watch-outs |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chat | `ChatActivity.kt`, `activity_chat.xml`, `view_assistant_bot_message.xml`, `view_assistant_user_message.xml`, `view_message.xml`, `ChatAdapter.kt` | Drawer (5.2), pill input bar, restyled bubbles, top bar polish, bulk-select bar restyle | **Highest.** Honor the ID contract (9.1, 9.2). Don't touch mic/keyboard/streaming logic. `Theme.Transparent` + `adjustPan` stay. |
| Floating assistant | `AssistantFragment.kt`, `fragment_assistant.xml` | Mirror chat input/bubble restyle only — no drawer | High. Own ID contract (9.3). Bottom-sheet behavior untouched. |
| Chats list (until Step C retires it) | `ChatsListFragment.kt`, `fragment_chats_list.xml`, `view_chat_name(_min).xml`, `ChatListAdapter.kt` | Restyle rows/FABs; row design is reused by the drawer | Medium. Avatar/initials logic in adapter. |
| Quick Settings sheet | `QuickSettingsBottomSheetDialogFragment.kt`, `fragment_quick_settings.xml` | M3 list rows, slider restyle, lorebook checklist polish | Medium-high: ~1k lines wiring `btnSelect*` ConstraintLayout ids — keep all ids/types. Canary for palette inheritance in sheets. |
| Main/home | `MainActivity.kt`, `activity_main.xml`, `bottom_menu.xml` | Step B forwarding; Step C removes bottom nav | Medium. Debug overlay (BlurView) must keep working until removed deliberately. |

### 7.2 Settings & management screens (medium care)

| Screen | Files | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Control Center | `SettingsActivity.kt`, `activity_settings.xml`, `TileFragment` | Tile → M3 row/card restyle; add **Appearance → Theme palette** picker here. Contains legacy `tileRemoveAds` remnants (`activity_remove_ads.xml`, strings) from upstream — ask owner before deleting; hide at minimum. |
| Characters hub | `CharactersActivity.kt`, `activity_characters.xml` | Same tile restyle. |
| Voice settings | `VoiceSettingsActivity.kt` + `VoiceAdvancedSettingsActivity.kt` | Advanced screen is deliberately plain rows (CLAUDE.md) — modernize gently, keep the row structure and every existing control. Insets were recently fixed; don't regress. |
| List screens: Personas, API endpoints, Activation prompts, Logit bias (x2), Lorebooks, Lorebook entries, Whisper models (x2) | respective `activity_*.xml` + `view_*_item.xml` + adapters | Restyle item layouts + FABs only; keep adapter view-binding ids; keep delete-confirmation dialogs. Lorebook screens show tag/description under headers — preserve. |
| Dialog fragments (~20: edit persona/endpoint/lorebook/entry/prompt/bias, model selectors, language/voice selectors, system message, add chat, message edit, action selector, report sheet) | `fragment_*.xml` | Batch by family. `EditPersonaDialogFragment` is sacred: the edit path must keep passing **every** field through (persona rename = delete + recreate; dropping a field silently loses data — CLAUDE.md invariant). |

### 7.3 Low-risk / cosmetic-only

About, Tips, Documentation, Logs, Translator, Image viewer, AI photo editor,
photo variations, fine-tune screens (3), onboarding (Welcome → Purpose →
Activation → Terms — keep the flow and exported intents intact), permission
activities, crash handler. Restyle freely; same palette/inset rules.
Leave untouched unless asked: `DebugMaterial`, the Teapots activity,
`Theme.PWA`, `activity_data_sources*.xml` (orphaned).

---

## 8. Phase plan (each box = one or more small PRs)

- **Phase 0 — Groundwork** (tiny, mechanical): bump material to `1.14.0`
  stable; add explicit `androidx.drawerlayout:drawerlayout:1.2.0`; create
  `ThemeManager.applyPalette()` with only the `violet` overlay defined as an
  empty/no-op overlay and wire the call into every activity `onCreate`
  (zero visual change — this PR proves the wiring compiles everywhere).
- **Phase 1 — Theme-attribute migration** ✅ (commit 1a2b8ae): migrated layout, drawable, menu, and color-state XML from hard-coded `@color/accent_*` / `@color/window_background` references to Material theme attributes; updated the vector icon tint convention. `rg '@color/(accent|window_background)' app/src/main/res/layout app/src/main/res/drawable app/src/main/res/drawable-v24 app/src/main/res/color app/src/main/res/menu` now returns no matches. Kotlin runtime color lookups remain for a later, narrower pass because many are AMOLED/state-machine-specific and need screen-by-screen behavioral verification.
- **Phase 2 — Palettes shipped**: define the 5 overlays (light+dark role
  sets), the `ui_palette` preference, the Appearance picker UI with swatches,
  `recreate()` flow. Verify AMOLED still correct on every screen family.
- **Phase 2.5 (optional) — AMOLED-as-overlay cleanup**, screen-by-screen.
- **Phase 3 — Drawer**: Step A (drawer in ChatActivity), then Step B
  (launch into last chat), then Step C (retire bottom nav) — three PRs.
- **Phase 4 — Chat restyle**: input pill, bubbles, top bar; mirrored
  `AssistantFragment` changes in the same PR (or back-to-back PRs).
- **Phase 5 — Settings & Characters restyle** (tiles → rows/cards).
- **Phase 6 — List screens & item layouts.**
- **Phase 7 — Dialogs & bottom sheets.**
- **Phase 8 — Onboarding, About, misc + cleanup** (dead RemoveAds remnants
  with owner approval; motion polish; this doc + CLAUDE.md updated to final
  state).

## 9. Pitfalls, dangers, and binding contracts

This is the section the owner asked for explicitly. **Read before every PR.**

### 9.1 ChatActivity view-ID contract (verified at `ChatActivity.kt:1370-1397`)

`activity_chat.xml` MUST keep these ids with these widget types (Kotlin
casts them; renaming or retyping = crash or silent breakage):

`btn_micro` (ImageButton), `btn_settings` (ImageButton), `messages`
(RecyclerView), `message_input` (EditText), `btn_send` (ImageButton),
`progress` (CircularProgressIndicator), `chat_activity_title` (TextView),
`btn_export` (ImageButton), `action_bar` (ConstraintLayout), `btn_back`
(ImageButton), `keyboard_frame` (ConstraintLayout), `root`
(ConstraintLayout), `thread_loader` (LinearLayout), `keyboard_input`
(LinearLayout), `btn_attach` (ImageButton), `attachedImage` (LinearLayout),
`selectedImage` (ImageView), `btnRemoveImage` (ImageButton),
`vision_action_selector` (LinearLayout), `action_camera`, `action_gallery`
(ImageButtons), `bulk_container` (ConstraintLayout), `btn_select_all`,
`btn_deselect_all`, `btn_delete_selected`, `btn_copy_selected`,
`btn_share_selected` (ImageButtons), `text_selected_count` (TextView),
`expandable_window_root` (CoordinatorLayout, keeps
`transitionName="chat_expand"`), `attach_bg` (BlurView).

### 9.2 ChatAdapter item-layout contract (verified at `ChatAdapter.kt:210-221`)

ALL THREE message item layouts (`view_message.xml`,
`view_assistant_user_message.xml`, `view_assistant_bot_message.xml`) must
each contain: `ui` (ConstraintLayout), `icon` (ImageView), `message`
(TextView), `username` (TextView), `dalle_image` (ImageView), `btn_copy`,
`btn_edit`, `btn_retry`, `btn_report`, `btn_share`, `btn_speak`
(ImageButtons). Only `bubble_bg` (ConstraintLayout) is nullable/optional.
The adapter does **no null checks** on the rest — a missing id crashes on
first bind. If the redesign hides a button, hide it via
`visibility="gone"`, never by deleting the view.

### 9.3 AssistantFragment contract (verified at `AssistantFragment.kt:2566-2596`)

`fragment_assistant.xml` requires: `btn_assistant_voice`,
`assistant_voice_clickable`, `btn_assistant_settings`,
`btn_assistant_show_keyboard`, `btn_assistant_hide_keyboard`,
`btn_assistant_send`, `btn_save`, `btn_exit`, `btn_clear_conversation`,
`assistant_message`, `input_layout`, `assistant_actions`,
`assistant_conversation`, `assistant_loading`, `assistant_title`, `ui`,
`window`, `btn_assistant_attach`, plus the same attach/vision/bulk ids as
ChatActivity (`attachedImage`, `selectedImage`, `btnRemoveImage`,
`vision_action_selector`, `action_camera`, `action_gallery`,
`bulk_container`, `btn_*_selected`, `text_selected_count`).

### 9.4 The voice state machine is drawn by hand

`micIdle()` / `micRecording()` / `micHandsFreeActive()` in ChatActivity (and
their AssistantFragment counterparts) directly call `setImageResource` /
`setColorFilter` / `backgroundTintList` on `btn_micro` using:
- drawables `ic_microphone`, `ic_stop_recording`
- colors `mic_listening_green`, `hands_free_active_red` (palette-fixed, see 4.3)
- hints `R.string.hint_message`, `R.string.hint_listening`

Renaming any of these, or restyling `btn_micro` with a static tint in XML,
fights the runtime state machine. The mic button's *idle* look can change;
its *state* visuals are owned by code. There is no defensive fallback —
errors here are silent or crash at the worst moment (mid-conversation).

### 9.5 Other binding rules (mostly from CLAUDE.md — they all still apply)

1. **Two generation funnels** (`ChatActivity.generateResponse` /
   `AssistantFragment`'s parallel one). UI affordances around generation
   (progress, cancel, restore) exist in both; change both.
2. **`restoreUIState()` / `restoreTopBarVisibility()`**: any new UI element
   whose state changes during generation must be reset there (in a
   `finally`), and `GenerationForegroundService` ref-counting must stay in
   the `try/finally`. The top-bar heal exists because an interrupted
   shared-element transition leaves `action_bar` invisible — keep the heal
   if you restyle the top bar.
3. **Auto-naming copy block**: any *new per-chat preference* (e.g. nothing
   in this plan should need one, but if one appears) must be added to the
   preference-copy block in ChatActivity, and auto-naming must never
   relaunch ChatActivity.
4. **Keyboard/IME choreography**: ChatActivity uses `adjustPan` + manual
   inset handling around `keyboard_frame` / `message_input`. Don't wrap
   `message_input` in a `TextInputLayout` (the code does
   `findViewById<EditText>`), don't add competing inset listeners.
5. **RecyclerView assumptions**: streaming calls
   `adapter.updateLastMessage(...)`, `chat.scrollToPosition(...)`,
   `clearSpeakingPosition()`. Keep `messages` a RecyclerView with
   `ChatAdapter`. Do not migrate it to anything else.
6. **Markwon renders messages.** Restyle bubbles around the `message`
   TextView; don't replace the markdown pipeline or set conflicting
   `textAppearance` mid-stream.
7. **Strings only in `res/values/strings.xml`**; never edit other locales
   unless asked. Removing a string requires removing usages — but orphaned
   translations in locale files are harmless; missing *default* strings
   break the build.
8. **Copyright header on every new file**; comments explain constraints/why.
9. **Do-not-touch list** (CLAUDE.md): Ktor 2.3.12, TLS/OkHttp defaults,
   native JNI loading gates, checked-in debug keystore, `ChatPreferences`
   parse-failure preservation. UI PRs have no business near any of these.
10. **AMOLED runtime blocks**: before declaring a screen "restyled", run
    `grep -n "amoled\|getAmoledPitchBlack" <screen>.kt` and reconcile every
    hit with the new layout (see 4.4).
11. **Shared drawables restyle many screens at once** (`btn_accent_tonal_v4/
    v5/v6`, `btn_accent_icon_large_100` are also retinted by
    `ThemeManager.applyTheme` for AMOLED). When changing a screen's look,
    prefer a new drawable over editing a shared one, unless the change is
    intentionally global.
12. **`Theme.Transparent` is load-bearing** for ChatActivity/SettingsActivity
    (translucent window + shared-element transitions + the
    `expandable_window_background_24` rounded sheet look). Restyle the
    drawable; keep the theme's translucency flags.
13. **Voice diagnostics**: if a UI change adds/removes a voice-loop exit
    path or mic affordance, log it via `ChatActivity.logVoiceEvent` (CLAUDE.md).
14. **Exported activities** (`AssistantActivity` intent filters,
    `WelcomeActivity`) and the onboarding chain must keep their manifest
    entries and flow.

### 9.6 Process pitfalls

- **No local compile.** A "small" XML typo costs a full CI round-trip.
  Static-verify everything (Section 0, rule 2) — especially that every id in
  Sections 9.1–9.3 still exists after editing those layouts.
- **Don't trust this document over the code.** Re-grep the contracts before
  editing the files they describe; update this doc if drift is found.
- **Screenshots:** CI builds a debug APK on `main` pushes; the owner tests
  on a Pixel 8. After each visual phase lands, summarize for the owner *in
  user terms* what changed and what to check (especially: hands-free voice
  loop end-to-end, AMOLED mode, chat rename, image attach).

## 10. Per-PR verification checklist (extends CLAUDE.md's)

1. CLAUDE.md checklist items 1–6 (clean status, R.* resolve, both funnels,
   copy block, DB rules, CI green).
2. Every id in Sections 9.1–9.3 still present with the same widget type, if
   the PR touched those layouts.
3. `grep amoled` reconciliation done for every Kotlin file whose layout
   changed.
4. No new hard-coded `@color/accent_*` in layouts (post-Phase-1).
5. New strings in default `strings.xml` only; no locale edits.
6. Insets: top bar below status bar, bottom controls above nav bar/IME, on
   the redesigned screen.
7. No dependency changes other than those named in this plan.
8. This document's phase list updated if a phase completed.
